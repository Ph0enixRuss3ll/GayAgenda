    <h1>Compassionate correctional facillities</h1>
    <main><p>Life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness - I like to think those are divine rights for every person. And yet, I live in the USA where it seems all three of 
        those things are privileges threatened by a terrorist government. Some people deserve life in prison; no government deserves the right to kill. The death penalty 
        is the trademark of a terrorist nation, and right after that are correctional facillities that offer no oppertunity for correction. There's literal slavery in the American
        prison system where paranoid conservatives would rather treat those they catch as scapegoats than offer compassionate oppertunity for correction. It could 
        be a place of free assisted living, therapy, and education for anyone willing to trade privacy and right to self-medicate for those things; it could be a 
        place where any illegal immigrant or refugee could choose to work for a year to earn a decent wage, make a housing plan, and earn a visa. It could be a place of 
        constant surveillance with just as many, if not more, rewards as punishment. Put cameras everywhere in there and let anyone watch online. Let peaceful inmates 
        choose their cellmate and do whatever's consensual. Let gay inmates make money with sex shows and straight inmates make money with music shows. Everyone, even 
        criminals, deserve the right to pursue happiness by finding ways to get involved in work they enjoy. </p>
        <p>Privacy is privilege in this age of surveillance, but here at the start of it we're in this strange place of toxic positiviety that values 
            happiness over truth and glorifies evil clown conartists like Donald Trump. Fraud and sexual assault are not presidential behavior! And I hope that 
            evil clown is the death of the Republican party. Government should be a respectful debate between socialists and libertarians, not gang wars between 
            a red and blue team that can't even agree and what's objective reality. 
        </p> 
        <p>Peace is justice: equal punishment for equal crimes regardless of ethnicity, gender, nationality, or bank account. The whole concept of Israel declaring 
            war on Palestine is a crime. Palestine is not a sovereign nation; it's just Isreal declaring war on a minority within its borders. They either need to 
            be two seperate countries or Isreal needs equal rights for all its citezens regardless of ethnicity.
