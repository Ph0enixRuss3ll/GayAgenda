    <h1>Free and fair elections.</h1>
    <main><p>No one deserves to rule for life and term limits are the best protection against tyrany. Faith in free and fair elections can be just as important as 
        free and fair elections. In the United States, convicted criminal Donald Trump continues to be a traitor to his nation by perteptuating lies that the 
        previous presidential election was rigged. Alegations without evidence is harrassment and the whole Republican party thinks being a sore loser is a 
        valid excuse the harrass the validitiy of the democratic process.</p>
        <p>
            Capitalism is too much about selfishness and communism is too much about selflessness. Both are wrong. A person and a society needs a healthy balance 
            of the two. Socialism done right could move healthy competition from companies to indiviuals; from schools to teachers; let the best teachers make 
            the MOST money and write the cirriculum for all the rest. Democratic socialism would determine who's the best at what by free and fair elections for 
            a certain term limit with a peaceful transfer of power between each term.
