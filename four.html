    <h1>Freedom of speech</h1>
    <main><p>
        Dec 7th 2022 I was banned from twitter for tweeting, "I hope Joe Biden dies rather than lives to perpetuate the all-American illness of work yourself to 
        death because you never built a life worth retiring from work for." This was judged to be 'harrassment'! Of a public figure who never read the tweet and 
        probably wouldn't have cared if he had. It was probably an excuse to ban me for being a shameless homosexual. At this point, I'm a conscientious objector of the whole twittersphere for their disgusting abuse of the freedom they pretend to have. I'm still mad about it, but I don't get mad; I stay mad. Anger is not so bad if it motivates you to be a better 
    person; it's what changes a dirty bird to a phoenix. That's the day I joined Reddit. I'm semi-careful on there but also not too active on there because 
anything that doesn't fit a mod's perverted idea of reality gets banned with no oppertunity to appeal the verdict. As I fight for my financial freedom with 
getting involved with web design and programming, I'm not giving up my artistic freedom. (Why I link my Reddit account that's primarily my works of erotic fiction) I've got an opinion on everything, but I don't need to fight about 
everything. Peace, love, and joy I value in that order. I rarely love someone enough to argue with them.</p>
        
    <p>Mandatory retirement from public office at age 75 is just one of the many changes that my xenophobic republic needs. Unfortunately, American hubris is 
        calling any call for change unpatriotic. America: the land of idealized vigilante justice and realized mass murder. Cancel the second ammendment and 
        support the right to abortion. These hateful conservatives dishonor the women who choose to sacrifice to make a baby by trying to make it mandatory.

    <p>I voted for Biden in 2020 and will again this year because Donald Trump is an evil-clown trust-fund-brat trying to make a joke out of truth and justice. 
        Trump is most likely the anti-christ. Christianity: welcome the stranger and love the guilty. Trump's cult of corrupted Christianity: blame all our problems 
        on the Mexicans and murder anyone the mob thinks is guilty. I wouldn't be too sad if they did "Hang Pence". But I really don't want Trump back in office to 
        perpetuate the American terrorism of lying about how 'self-made' the trust-fund-brats are. It's crony capitalism devolving into neofuedalism where it's 
        impossible to get ahead without inheritance.

        We need socialized education for equal oppertunity to earn privilege. It's hard to even discuss the difference between rights and privileges in today's 
        America where anything that's not a joke is censored to oblivion. Bet an equal number of Israeli and Palesinian children just want to live their own 
        lives without they parent's prejudice. Socialized education would be the best way to combate inheritance keeping spoiled children in power and robbing 
        everyone of self-respect.

        Special thanks to Buddhism for helping to have ideals without ever sacrificing personal peace for them. Special thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.org</a> for helping me 
        get my computer education started.
