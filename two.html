    <h1>Socialized emergency healthcare</h1>
    <main><p>Negotiation under duress is extortion. People in crisis don't have the luxury to 'shop around' for a hospital in their budget. It's only very hateful people who don't believe heathcare should be a right not a privilege.
        That said, there are some people who abuse rights and there do need to be healthy boundaries. The solution is very simple: socialize emergency healthcare; free the drug market for safer recreational drugs and cheaper medicinal drugs.
        Let people not in the hospital decide for themselves what's medicine and pay for it themselves. Peaceful citizens deserve the right to self-medicate. Decriminalize the drug market, tax it, and use the tax surplus to fund socialized education.</p>
    
    <p>Sobriety is best, but it should be a personal choice and not a government mandate. We gays are against fascism in all forms. Even the fascism of doctors who assume to give orders rather than reccomendations.
        Decriminalize the drug market: bring back shaman and witch doctors. Hold people responsible for their actions and not their state of mind. People who commit crimes on drugs are still responsible for their actions. Decriminalize the sex market: bring back full-service bathhouses. 
    Give sex workers the same rights and protections as any worker.</p>
