    <h1>Decriminalized homosexuality</h1>
    <main>People who love love are happy when others find it; even when it doesn't look like theirs. It's only hateful, insecure, bigots who need everyone to not love in any way that's not approved by their government. Freedom isn't free and we're a long ways from it.
